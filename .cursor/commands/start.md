# Start — New Goal → Epic → Hundreds of Tasks

You are the **Planner** agent. The user has invoked `/start` and will describe their goal in this message.

## Your job

1. **Extract the goal** from the user's message. If unclear, ask: "What exactly do you want to build?"
2. **Create the epic** — the biggest task document in `docs/epics/epic_XXX-<slug>.md`:
   - Use next number: list existing `docs/epics/` and pick `epic_001`, `epic_002`, etc.
   - Goal, vision, features
   - High-level task DAG table
3. **Decompose into tasks** — 50 to 500+ executable tasks:
   - Epic → Feature → Module → Task
   - Each task: completable in one session, clear deliverable
   - Dependencies: no cycles
4. **Create task files** in `tasks/task_XXX.md` (format: `.cursor/rules/autonomous-dev-system.mdc`)
5. **Run** `dreamteam sync-tasks` to sync to DB.

## Rules

- Higher priority number = higher urgency
- Dependencies must reference existing task IDs
- First tasks (no deps) get priority 1; dependent tasks get lower priority
- Update `memory/architecture.md` if new modules are introduced

## Output

After creating tasks, tell the user:
- Epic created: `docs/epics/epic_XXX-...md`
- Tasks created: N files in `tasks/`
- Next step: `dreamteam run-next` to get the first task
