# Planner Task Decomposition

## When to Use

- New goal or epic to implement
- User requests task breakdown or planning
- Meta Planner requests task resplitting

## Workflow

1. **Read context:** `.dreamteam/memory/architecture.md`, `.dreamteam/memory/summaries.md`
2. **Decompose:** Epic → Feature → Module → Tasks
3. **Define dependencies:** Build DAG (no cycles)
4. **Assign priorities:** Higher number = higher priority
5. **Create task files:** `.dreamteam/tasks/task_XXX.md`
6. **Insert into database:** Use `dreamteam sync-tasks` or direct SQLite

## Task Format

See `.cursor/rules/autonomous-dev-system.mdc`.

## Output

- Task markdown files in `.dreamteam/tasks/`
- Database rows in `.dreamteam/db/dag.db` (tasks table)
- Updated `.dreamteam/memory/architecture.md` if new modules are introduced

## Rules

- No circular dependencies
- Each task should be completable in one session
- Dependencies must reference existing task IDs
